# Sinatra Todo App
---

## Getting Started

- Run `psql -d sinatra_todo -f todo.sql` from within the directory.
- `ruby app.rb`
- Navigate to `localhost:4567`

## Next Steps

**Investigate the code!**

Don't worry about the styling. It was an excuse to play with [Google Material Design](http://materializecss.com/).

Concentrate on the `app.rb` file as that is a template you can use for your _RESTful_ routing!

Take a look at the forms. Especially the one on `edit.erb`. See how you can use the `value` attribute on the `input` tag to pre-populate the textbox.
